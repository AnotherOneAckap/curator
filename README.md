# How it works

Just run it, every half-hour it will ask you about your current task, answer will be written to log file, which is located in your home directory. Then you can review it.

# Dependencies

It is supposed you run OS with some shell interpreter like `sh` or `bash`, have some kind of home directory and `zenity` is installed. Actually I wrote it for Ubuntu 18.04.
